# Alpine + Nix Package Manager!

Template for developers wanting to create a Nix environment for development purposes or other forseen features. Includes Direnv so you can have multiple flakes from multiple repositories and direnv will check out the directories flake packages. Contains a shared Nix Store mount for your workspaces so that the build times won't take as long.
